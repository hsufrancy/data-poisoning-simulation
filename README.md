# 👩🏻‍🔬 Data Poisoning Simulation

This repository is for the implement section of my final research paper in MPCS 56511 Introduction to Computer Security at the University of Chicago.
In the simulation file, I aim to simulate the impact of data poisoning on an original dataset and then apply mitigation techniques (Data Cleaning and Anomaly Detection) outlined in Section VI (c) in my paper. However, due to the limited availability of relevant source codes online and the complexity of certain implementations beyond my domain knowledge, I designed the experiment independently.

Using an artificial dataset and machine learning techniques I am familiar with, I developed a customized approach to evaluate and counteract data poisoning.
